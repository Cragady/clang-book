# Overview

This repo is going to be my journey through c-lang. It's going to probably me a mix of `ANSI C` & `c17`. What this means, is it's probably going to look mostly like ANSI C, with some c17 sprinkled in I guess.

Mostly, I'll do what the internet and the compiler tells me to do.

I may do a lot of what `The C Programming Language` Second Edition, ANSI C, has specified, or I may not. My main interest is with pointers. The code will have a lot of what's written in the book, along with some modifications where I'm trying to print to the output to see what's going on, and maybe changing some things to observe it's behavior.

I'm following along the book on linux (Ubuntu) because I do not want to deal with this on Windows. ~~I could find a port of GCC on Windows, or use WSL.~~

Also, the makefile _may_ not be portable. So, if that's the case, ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯, I could address this at some point, but the makefile's commands should be so simple, it's just a copy/pasta job with some changes.

This may bleed into heavier memory management, or it may not.
